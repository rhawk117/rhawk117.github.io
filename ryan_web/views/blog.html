                                If you’re anything like me, you likely spend most of your day on the Internet whether it be for school, work, or for leisure.
                                Additionally, most of the time we do spend on the Internet at least in a Desktop environment, is generally spent in a Web Browser
                                which we use to access the same handful of websites. In order to visit these websites, we are required to enter in the
                                associated uniform resource locator or URL, which is then processed by the Domain Name System which then will map the URL enetered into a
                                tangible IP address. This process can become quite tedious and time-consuming especially if you’re someone like me who
                                visits and uses multiple websites on a daily basis. However, we can reduce this menial task to just a few keystrokes by using
                                the simple and flexible Python script I’ve created.

                                Managing files and folders on your computer can quickly become a time consuming organizational nightmare. 
                                To solve this issue I've created a custom file manager command line interface in Python to organize my school work and save my time. 
                                In this blog post, I'll walk you through on how to build this program from start to finish using 
                                modules like OS, Pathlib, and shutil to interact with files. This program also utilizes regular expressions which
                                are used to validate user input and to also find files with a specific extension. Despite the file manager being tailored for my computer and workflow,
                                the concepts and techniques used can be applied to create your own automated file manager.
