This is the GitHub Repo for my personal portfolio website that I created from scratch using solely HTML and CSS.
On my website you'll find a variety of background information about my skills, education and background. Additionally,
the website features a personal blog that is updated regularly with posts documenting Cyber Security and Computer Science
projects I've completed. The website currently is only designed for Desktop viewing however I fully intend on incorporating
responsive web design techniques and fleshing out the static HTML & CSS into a dynmaic web app.
